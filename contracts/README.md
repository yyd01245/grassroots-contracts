# Grassroots

Grassroots is a crowdfunding development platform for EOSIO software. It allows account holders to vote native system tokens to fund projects, applications, or research and development.

Funds are sent to the contract and staked to the user's account. The user can then allocate an amount of tokens to projects as they see fit. A user can `reclaim` any unallocated system tokens out of the contract and back to their eosio.token account at any time.

In order to `unallocate` funds from a project, the user simply calls an action and specifies the proposal along with the amount to unallocate. Funds unallocated return to the contract wallet and can then either be reallocated to another project or reclaimed.
